# vscode-spass

A very simple vscode extension to add syntax highliting for the SPASS theorem prover.

I have created this extension to use it in the "logica e algebra" course at Politecnico di Milano, it is not meant to be production ready and I will probably abandon it once the I have finished the course.

I have used [this](https://webspass.spass-prover.org/help/spass-input-syntax15.pdf) as a reference for implementing the syntax.

## Features

- very crude syntax highliting for SPASS files.
- Recognized file extensions:`.dfg`, `.frm`, `.cnf`, `.dnf`, `.prf`, `.spass`

## Known Issues

None, for now...

## Releases

Look [here](https://github.com/darcros/vscode-spass/releases) for releases.
